---

## Add a publication

Open `publications.html`.

**Most-cited highlight** (top block, with a citation bar) — copy an existing `<li class="pub">`:

```html
<li class="pub" style="--w:.302">
  <div class="pub-main">
    <h3 class="pub-title">Paper title exactly as published</h3>
    <p class="pub-meta"><span class="venue venue-top">Nature Photonics</span>
       First Author, Y.-H. Kim, <em>et al.</em> · 2021</p>
  </div>
  <div class="pub-cite"><span class="cite-count">983</span><span class="cite-bar"></span></div>
</li>
```

- `--w` is the citation bar length = `this paper's citations ÷ top paper's citations`
  (top = 3,256). So 983 → `--w:.302`.
- Use `venue-top` on the `<span class="venue">` for flagship venues (Science/Nature/…); plain
  `venue` otherwise.

**By-year entry** (lower blocks, no citation count) — copy an existing `<li>` in the right
`.pub-year` group:

```html
<li><span class="pnum">117</span><span>
  <span class="ptitle">Paper title</span>
  <span class="pmeta"><span class="venue">Journal</span>First Author <em>et al.</em>, Y.-H. Kim*</span>
</span></li>
```

Create a new `.pub-year` block if you add a new year (highest year first).

## Add a member

Open `team.html`, find the right `.member-group` inside `#panel-members` (Postdoctoral
Researcher / Ph.D. Students / M.S. Students / External Collaborators), and copy an existing
`.mcard`:

```html
<article class="mcard">
  <div class="mcard-top">
    <img class="mphoto" src="assets/img/members/firstname-lastname.jpg" alt="Given Name Family" />
    <span><span class="mname">Given Name Family</span><span class="mrole">Ph.D–M.S. · 1st year</span></span>
  </div>
  <p class="mint"><span class="mint-label">Research</span>Displays</p>
</article>
```

Save the photo (square crop, ~360×360, optimized) to `assets/img/members/`. If there's no
photo yet, use the initials-avatar pattern instead: `<span class="mavatar" aria-hidden="true">GF</span>`
(add `class="mavatar pd"` for a postdoc — gold instead of navy).

## Add a figure to a publication, news item, or highlight

Every figure is a plain link wrapped in `.gallery` — this is what makes it work with JS
disabled (the browser just opens the image) and gives the lightbox something to enhance
with JS on. Save the image to the matching folder (`assets/img/publications/`,
`assets/img/news/`, or `assets/img/highlights/`), then add:

**Single image** — publications by-year list (add `class="has-thumb"` to the `<li>`):
```html
<li class="has-thumb"><span class="pnum">117</span><span>…</span>
  <div class="pub-thumb"><div class="gallery">
    <a class="gallery-item" href="assets/img/publications/pub-117-example.jpg" data-caption="Journal, Year.">
      <img src="assets/img/publications/pub-117-example.jpg" alt="Describe the figure" loading="lazy" />
    </a>
  </div></div>
</li>
```
Publications *highlights* (`.pub`) use the same `.pub-thumb` block as a 4th child alongside
`.pub-main`/`.pub-cite`. News items use `.news-thumb` instead of `.pub-thumb` and need
`class="has-gallery"` on the `<li class="news-item">`.

**Multiple images (2+)** — add more `.gallery-item` links inside the same `.gallery`; the
first one is the representative image (put a `<span class="gallery-badge">+N</span>` inside
its `<a>`, after the `<img>`, where N = the *other* images' count). The lightbox groups every
`.gallery-item` sharing one `.gallery` ancestor automatically — no JS config needed.

**Highlights page** — each `.hl-card` is its own `.gallery`; follow the pattern of an existing
card in `highlights.html` and add a new one (newest first) with date + caption in `.hl-card-body`.

## Add an alumnus

Open `team.html`, `#panel-alumni`, and copy an existing card in the `.member-group`:

```html
<article class="mcard">
  <div class="mcard-top"><span class="mavatar" aria-hidden="true">GF</span><span><span class="mname">Given Name Family</span><span class="mrole">Ph.D. · 2022–2025</span></span></div>
  <p class="alum-meta">Degree, Department, Institution<br /><span class="now">Now: current position</span></p>
</article>
```

## Add a news item

Two places (keep them consistent):

1. `news.html` — add a `<li class="news-item">` at the top (most recent first):
   ```html
   <li class="news-item"><span class="news-date">2026 · 07</span>
     <p><strong>Name</strong> did the thing — covered by X, Y.</p></li>
   ```
2. `index.html` — if it's a headline, add/rotate a `.newsprev-item` card in the "Latest news"
   block so the home page stays current (keep it to 3).

## Refresh the metrics (citations / h-index / i10 / publications)

These numbers are **literal text in several files**. Update all occurrences:

- `16,187` (citations) — `index.html`, `team.html`, `publications.html`
- `49` (h-index) — same three
- `88` (i10-index) — `team.html`, `publications.html`
- `116` (publications) — `index.html`, `publications.html` (title + metric)

Grep for each number to catch every spot. Then update any "Source: Google Scholar, July 2026"
caption to the new date.

## Update the citation chart

Open `index.html`, block `#spectrum-bars`. Each bar:

```html
<div class="bar" style="--h:.878;--c:#5cbf55" data-year="2021" data-val="1789"></div>
```

- `--h` = that year's citations ÷ the max year's citations (currently max = 2038 in 2025).
- `--c` = the bar color; keep the violet→red spectrum sweep across years.
- `data-val` = the raw number shown on hover.
- Mark an incomplete current year with `class="bar partial"` and note it in the caption.

When you add a new year, recompute all `--h` if the new value becomes the max.

## Change a color / font / spacing

Edit the `:root` block in `assets/styles.css`. Don't hardcode hex in components — use the
tokens. See `DESIGN.md`.

## After any edit

Serve locally (`python -m http.server 4600`) and **look at the page in a browser** — desktop
and a narrow mobile width — before considering it done.
